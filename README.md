# midterm

I change my project topic because my project in initial summary was very very simple.

This project about online shop
There are 3 entities on database:
1) Users 
2)Roles (it's for isentify admin and user)
3)Items of shop

I use SpringSequrity for base confugiration of authentication

I just finish only login page

Also I add feature to change the language 

There are privileges for admin
Only admin can add items, delete items
Users just can only see list of all irems

I add simple user interface(html, css)
